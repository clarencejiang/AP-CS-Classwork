Project: Eating In McDonald


Description: 
I want to use java codes to demonstrate
the real scene in life while students 
going to a McDonald to have meal.
 
1.The main method should include the 
decision about whether to eat in store 
or take it away based on count of other 
customers. 

2.Also it should includes a method to 
choose food, considering the “taste” 
(spicy, sweet, salty, etc), the money
taken, whether to use a coupon or not, 
how to pay (using phone or cash or credit card), 
pay method(through the shop assistant or using the
self-pay machine)

3. Also, today is a special day that 
McDonald decides to give certain customer 
a chance to get a bonus. Meeting certain
assumptions, they get a chance to get an
opportunity to gain gifts. 

Main Plan: 
Use different classes to fulfill 
different goals in the entire “eating”
process.
