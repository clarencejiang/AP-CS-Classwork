Define these terms: \
1. Inheritance 
\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 \cf2 \expnd0\expndtw0\kerning0
defines a relationship between objects that share characteristics. It is a mechanism that a new class, subclass, is created from an existing class, called a superclass. \
\
2. Superclass is the existing class, which helps create subclass by \'93inheriting\'94 its characteristics to the subclass. \
\
3.  Subclass is the class created based on previous existing class (superclass) \
\
4. Extend describes the mechanism that subclass inherits from superclass. In the code, extend indicates that the class before it is a subclass and the class after it is a superclass.\
\
5. super() a subclass can call a method in superclass through super();\
\
6. The difference between superclass and subclass is that subclass is one category of superclass that inherits superclass\'92s characteristics. For instance, superclass: animals \
Subclass: dogs. \
\
7 subclass is bigger.
